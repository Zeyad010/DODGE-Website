                     <span>Dodge</span> is an American brand of automobiles and a division of Stellantis, based in Auburn Hills,
                     Michigan. Dodge vehicles have historically included performance cars,
                     and for much of its existence Dodge was Chrysler's mid-priced brand above Plymouth.
                     Dodge mainstay vehicles were trucks and full-sized passenger cars through the 1970s,
                     though it also built compact cars such as the 1963–76 Dart and midsize cars such as the "B-Body" Coronet and Charger from 1965–78.
